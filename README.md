# ninR-137-Music-Player
Very raw music player (work In Progress)

For now its very bare bones, focusing storage permissions for both Android 11 above and below
It uses <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
Which means it is restricted in Google play (Planning to change that in the future)

Just a simple List view of all MP3 files in external storage where you can either play or stop
Will add more things but at the core thats all it is
